🟦 Project Objectives:
Understand overall sales performance and trends.

Identify top-selling products and high-performing categories.

Discover time-based ordering patterns and peak hours.

Examine customer behavior during special events (e.g., Valentine’s Day).

Suggest actionable strategies to boost underperforming areas.

🟧 Data Preparation and Tools Used:
Tools: Microsoft Excel (Pivot Tables, Slicers, Charts), PowerPoint for report presentation.

Process:

Cleaned and structured the raw sales data for consistent formatting.

Built Pivot Tables to summarize data by categories, time, and products.

Designed interactive dashboards using slicers, charts, and filters for real-time insights.

🟥 Dashboard Highlights & Deep Insights:
📊 1. Overall Sales Performance (2023):
Total Revenue: $61,716.91

Total Orders: Maximum 5370 (unfiltered), Minimum 57 (filtered for Valentine’s Day).

Average Items per Order: Between 1.03 (Breakfast) to 2.40 (Valentine's Day)

✅ Insight: A higher average item per order during special days suggests customers tend to buy more when dining for events.

🍔 2. Product & Category Analysis:
Top-Selling Items:

Big Mac (most frequently ordered)

Quarter Pounder with Cheese

Bulgogi Burger

Angus Third Pounder

Meatball Marinara

Category Performance:

🥇 Burgers – Highest revenue and order volume (2717+ orders)

🥈 Chicken

🥉 Pasta

🥤 Sides & Shakes – Least contribution to revenue

✅ Insight: McDonald's should continue focusing on Burger innovation and promotions, as it’s the top driver of both volume and revenue.

🕒 3. Time-Based Trends:
Peak Hours:

11 AM – 2 PM (Lunch rush)

6 PM – 8 PM (Dinner time)

Day-of-Week Analysis:

Weekdays contribute 70–72% of sales

Weekends drop to 28–30%

✅ Insight: Additional weekend promotions could help balance the weekly sales dip.

🥐 4. Category Filtering – Focus on Breakfast:
Breakfast Orders: Only 450 vs. 5370 overall

Lowest Average Items per Order: 1.03

❌ Insight: Breakfast is underperforming. There's potential for growth through bundled meal deals or promotional combos.

💘 5. Special Day Focus – Valentine’s Day (Feb 14):
Only 57 Orders recorded

Higher Averages: 2.40 items/order

Big Mac still remains the most ordered

✅ Insight: Low volume but larger orders – suggests that couples/families may prefer full meals rather than quick snacks. Also, McDonald’s may not be a primary choice for Valentine dining.
